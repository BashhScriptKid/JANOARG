Gameplay
- Flick notes
  + Timed: *Hell no*, but I have an idea to judge flick notes based on the angle of your flick instead,
  + Directional: Both directional and non-directional, maybe?
  + Requires tap: Could be a note modifier, that means a normal or catch note can have an arrow indicating flick direction

Editor:
- Ability to edit storyboard in timeline
- Keybinding for placing items to timeline
- Undo / redo (I'm too lazy to do this tbh)

Player (the Unity scene):
- Better in-game UI design
- Better result screen

Ideas for a very far future:
- Commission people for original songs
- A story line about friends in other universes
- Make incremental games
