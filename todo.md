Current todo:
- Gameplay
    + Fix end game splash always showing "all flawless" regardless of results
    + Save player's scores
    + Result screen extra details and graphs
- Setting panel
    + Make settings actually work
- Profile panel
    + Extra pages
        * Clicking on the level shows the statistics page (shows total number of songs played, favorite song, e.t.c.)
        * Clicking on the ability rating shows the rating breakdown similar to Arcaea's b30
    + Share buttons with full stat exporting (e.g. the rating breakdown image generated from the share button should have all 30 (or in-game equivalent) songs without the data being cropped)

Future plans:
- Get more songs
- Get more illustrators
- Make original characters/mascots
- Story (it is scientifically proven that if you put a visual novel into a rhythm game it'll become famous)
- Feed the snail (more üêå charts)
