 â€¢ <indent=2em><b>Ability Rating (AR)</b>
$n
<indent=2em>A rating associated with each player to indicate how well one is at playing the game. 
The AR system in JANOARG works by obtaining a "performance rating" for each of the charts the player has played, 
based on the chart's difficulty and the highest score achieved. The best 20 performance ratings are then summarised 
and averaged to output the final Ability Rating for the corresponding player.
